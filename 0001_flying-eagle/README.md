The City of Edmonton's Flying Eagle Program gives children the opportunity to learn more about Aboriginal cultures and heritage through games, crafts, and other recreational activities. Using the Medicine Wheel as a guide, Flying Eagle staff help program participants explore traditional Aboriginal practices, such as making bannock and dreamcatchers and taking part in Aboriginal sports like lacrosse.

The program runs for one week in various neighbourhoods each summer, as part of the City's Green Shack recreation program for children.
