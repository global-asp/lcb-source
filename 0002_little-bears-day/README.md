# maskosis okîsikâm (Little Bear’s Day)

## Summary

As Little Bear goes about his day, readers learn AI verbs that might apply to their own daily lives, and how to conjugate those verbs to describe others’ actions in the third person (singular).

This book has been written in the Plains Cree dialect, using spelling and grammar conventions most common in Edmonton and smaller communities in central Alberta. Language learners and teachers using the resources can customize the language to their community preferences.
