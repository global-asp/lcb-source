# Little Bear is New in Town

##
My mom just told me we are moving to Edmonton.

She is talking on the phone to a lady from an organization called New in Town in the city.

The lady is helping her figure out what we should do.

##
I go to see my grandma.

I feel sad. I don't want to leave.

She tells me that she loves me, and that I will get to see and do all kinds of neat things in the city.

##
I put my clothes and my favourite toys in my backpack. I say goodbye to my house.

We get on a big bus. My tummy feels yucky, so I have a nap on my moms lap. She wakes me up when we get close to Edmonton so I can see the city lights.

My mom says a lady from New in Town will pick us up from the bus station.

##
We go to live with my auntie. I share a room with my cousin.

I like sleeping in a bunk bed!

But sometimes I can't sleep because he snores, and the cars outside are so loud at night.

##
I have to go with my mom so she can fill out some forms.

The New in Town lady helps us take a big blue bus.

There are so many people that we have to stand on the bus while it's moving!s

##
My auntie takes me and my mom to Family Night at a school near her house.

The New in Town lady is there. She introduces me to some kids who will be in my class.

We have fun learning some cool hoop-dancing moves.

##
I feel nervous about my first day of school.

I ride a school bus just like my old bus.

I see my friends from Family Night and we play together at recess.

There are so many kids in my class!

##
I join the soccer team at my school. We play every Friday at lunch.

One of my teammates invites me to his birthday party.

We go swimming at West Edmonton Mall. I love the waterslides!

##
My auntie takes me and my cousin trick-or-treating.

There are so many houses, and they are so close together.

We don't have to walk very far to get a whole bagful of candy!

##
My mom gets a new job so I have to go to afterschool care.

I meet some new kids from other grades.

My favourite activity is when we all sing and play music together. I like to play my drum.

##
We are moving into a new house!

We don't have very much furniture, but now I have my own bed.

I miss sleeping in my cousin's bunk bed, but I can sleep better now without his snoring.

##
I have a new babysitter.

She takes me tobogganing, and afterwards we go inside the Muttart Conservatory to warm up.

We see lots of neat plants from all over the world. I love smelling the flowers and feeling so warm in the pyramids even though it is winter.

##
On New Years, my family takes the train to downtown.

All of the buildings are sooo tall.

We see the New in Town lady again. She counts down the seconds with us, and gives me a big hug at midnight.

##
My mom says I can pick one friend to come to my birthday party. I pick my new best friend.

We go have Indian tacos at Bannock Burger.

He had never had an Indian taco before, but he loves it!

##
I had a bad day at school today.

I forgot my lunch and my mom was at work so she couldn't bring it to me. PLUS some kids in my class teased me for being different.

I don't like it here. I want to move back home.

##
My mom takes me and my cousin to a round dance that Bent Arrow is putting on.

I see lots of people I know.

I have lots of fun dancing with my friends.

##
Today has been another bad day at school.

I miss my bus home, and at first I feel scared. I wonder if I will have to sleep at my school all alone. The secretary calls my mom and she comes to pick me up.

While I wait, my science teacher shows me a cool experiment! He tells me it's okay to be different, and I feel a lot better than my last bad day.

##
It's the last day of school before summer holidays.

Our class has a hot dog roast and plays games in a park.

I'm not too sad, because I know I'll see my friends at camps and swimming lessons during the summer.

##
My grandma calls me.

She asks me if I like living in Edmonton.

I miss seeing her every day, but I like that there are so many things for me to see and do here.

I ask her to come visit us soon so I can show her around and introduce her to all my friends.

##
I am visiting my family back on my reserve.

My cousin just found out that his family has to move to Edmonton. He feels sad.

I know how he feels. I tell him that it's not so badâ€”it's exciting to learn and see all the new things when you're new in town!
